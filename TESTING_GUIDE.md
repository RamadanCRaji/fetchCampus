## Known Issues to Test For

1. **Email Verification Loop**: Ensure user doesn't get stuck in verification screen
2. **Double Back Buttons**: Fixed, but verify it stays fixed
3. **Three Dots**: Fixed, but verify no pagination indicators appear
4. **API Keys**: Ensure GoogleService-Info.plist is gitignored
5. **Points Balance**: Ensure cannot send more than available
6. **Duplicate Requests**: Ensure cannot spam friend requests

## Test Data

### Test Users
Create these test accounts for comprehensive testing:
- User 1: Standard user with friends and points
- User 2: New user with 0 activity
- User 3: Power user with max achievements
- User 4: User with expiring points

### Test Scenarios
1. **New User Journey**: Sign up â†’ Verify â†’ Add friend â†’ Send gift
2. **Power User**: Multiple friends, high rank, many transactions
3. **Edge Cases**: 0 points, 0 friends, maximum values
