## 🔥 Firebase Integration

### Real-Time Data:

-  ✅ **User points** update live
-  ✅ **Activity feed** updates automatically
-  ✅ **Expiration timer** calculated from Firestore
-  ✅ **Profile data** synced across views

### Listeners:

```swift
// In HomeTabContent
userListener = FirestoreService.shared.listenToUser(userId: userId) { user in
    authManager.currentUser = user
}

activityListener = FirestoreService.shared.listenToActivities(userId: userId) { activities in
    self.activities = activities
}
```

### Data Flow:

1. User logs in → Firebase Auth
2. `AuthenticationManager` fetches user data
3. `MainTabView` displays with current user
4. Real-time listeners update UI automatically
5. Changes in Firestore → Instant UI update

## 🐛 If You See Issues

### Tab icons still tiny:

-  Make sure you're using the NEW `MainTabView.swift`
-  Verify `FetchApp.swift` calls `MainTabView()` not `HomeView()`
-  Clean build folder (Shift+Cmd+K) and rebuild

### Profile not showing:

-  Check Firebase has user data
-  Verify `AuthenticationManager.currentUser` is populated
-  Check console for any Firebase errors

### Activity cards not appearing:

-  Expected! Sample data shows if Firestore has no activities
-  To test real activities, add them manually in Firestore Console

### Firebase errors:

-  Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is in project (not committed to Git)
-  Verify Firebase packages are added via SPM
-  Check Firebase Console for project status
